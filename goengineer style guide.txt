Okay, here is the GoEngineer Style Guide information compiled into a markdown format.

# GoEngineer Style Guide

## 1. Logos

### 1.1. Primary Logo
The primary logo consists of the "goengineer" logotype in GoEngineer Gray with the three-sided box mark in GoEngineer Green positioned above the logotype.

**goengineer** (logotype text)

#### 1.1.1. White Space
- Please keep a distance of white or quiet space around the logo.
- No other typography or graphic elements should be allowed to penetrate the white space.
- The white space is calculated by the height and width of the letter 'N' from the logo itself.

#### 1.1.2. Logo Type
- The logo type ("goengineer") is a proprietary hand-drawn font.
- Please use the fonts suggested in this document as complementary fonts for documents and marketing materials.
- Do not try to recreate or use fonts that are too close to the logotype, as these will compete with the logo rather than complement it.

#### 1.1.3. Logo Mark (in Primary Logo context)
- The three-sided box has been sized and positioned to work with the Logo Type.
- Please do not move it or scale it up or down when using it with the logo type in this lock-up.
- There will be occasions where it can be used on its own as a graphic element (see Logo Mark section) but never on the same page as the full lock-up shown above (primary logo).

### 1.2. Secondary Logo
The secondary logo consists of the three-sided box mark in GoEngineer Green positioned to the left of the "goengineer" logotype in GoEngineer Gray.

**goengineer** (logotype text)

### 1.3. Logo Mark (Standalone)
The standalone logo mark is the three-sided box icon, typically in GoEngineer Green.

### 1.4. Secondary Marks
- Variations of the logo mark (e.g., green striped, gray striped, green wireframe, gray wireframe).
- The secondary logo mark can be used as a graphic element of the brand.
- It can be used in both green and gray.
- It can be used as a watermark behind text as a ghosted back graphic.
