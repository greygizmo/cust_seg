# Sales Playbook: Building Call Lists

This guide shows how to build call lists using the ICP Dashboard.

## Where to Go
- Launch: `streamlit run apps/streamlit/app.py`
- In the sidebar choose: "Call List Builder"

## Filters to Start With
- Segment: choose Small/Mid/Large based on goals.
- Adoption band: pick High for expansion or Low for activation.
- Relationship band: Low for cross-sell opportunities.
- Toggles:
  - Revenue-only (no printers): good for hardware activation.
  - Heavy fleet (≥10 weighted): good for consumables/training.

## Export & CRM
- Click Export to save CSV under `reports/call_lists/YYYYMMDD/`.
- Import CSV into CRM using the “ICP Call List” template mapping (see CRM docs).

## Tags & Talking Points
- Upgrade Likely: high adoption, low relationship → discuss CAD/CPE packages.
- Consumables Focus: high printers, steady usage → auto-replenishment offers.
- Printer Expansion: heavy fleet, newer models in portfolio → trade-in/expansion.

## Tips
- Sort by ICP Grade (A/B first), then by Adoption.
- Use Recent Profit to avoid stale accounts.
