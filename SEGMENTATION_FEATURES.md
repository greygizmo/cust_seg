## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### New Functions Added
```python
# Core segmentation functions
determine_customer_segment(revenue, thresholds)
get_segment_metrics(df, segment_name, segment_thresholds)
create_segment_comparison_chart(df, segment_thresholds)
create_segment_distribution_chart(df, segment_thresholds)
```

### Session State Management
```python
# Segment configuration persistence
st.session_state.segment_config = {
    'small_business_max': 100000000, # $100M
    'mid_market_max': 1000000000    # $1B
}

# Selected segment persistence
st.session_state.selected_segment = 'All Segments'
```

### Data Processing Enhancements
