# ICP Scoring Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time customer segmentation analysis with adjustable weights for GoEngineer Digital Manufacturing accounts.

## Overview

This dashboard allows you to:
- **Adjust scoring weights in real-time** using interactive sliders
- **Visualize the impact** of weight changes on customer ICP scores
- **Identify high-value customers** with dynamic filtering
- **Export updated scores** for further analysis

## Features

### üéõÔ∏è Interactive Weight Controls
- **Vertical Weight** (30% default): Industry type scoring
- **Size Weight** (30% default): Company size based on revenue
- **Adoption Weight** (20% default): Technology adoption/scaling
- **Relationship Weight** (20% default): Software revenue tier

### üìä Real-time Visualizations
1. **ICP Score Distribution** - Histogram showing score spread
2. **Weight Distribution Radar** - Visual representation of current weights
3. **Score by Industry** - Average scores across verticals
4. **Printer Count vs Score** - Scatter plot showing relationships

### üìã Data Analysis
- **Key Metrics**: Total customers, average score, high-value count
- **Top Customers Table**: Dynamic ranking based on current weights
- **Export Functionality**: Download updated scores as CSV

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Ensure Data Files Exist**
   Make sure `icp_scored_accounts.csv` is in the same directory. If not, run:
   ```bash
   python goe_icp_scoring.py
   ```

3. **Launch Dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_icp_dashboard.py
   ```

## Scoring Methodology

### Individual Component Scores (0-1):

**Vertical Score:**
- Aerospace & Defense: 1.00
- Automotive: 0.90
- Medical Devices: 0.85
- High Tech/Consumer: 0.80
- Industrial Machinery: 0.70
- Government: 0.75

**Size Score:**
- 2-3 printers: 1.0 (optimal size)
- Other counts: 0.5

**Adoption Score:**
- 4+ printers (scaling): 1.0
- <4 printers: 0.0

**Relationship Score (CAD Tier):**
- Platinum (>$100K): 1.0
- Gold ($25K-$100K): 0.9
- Silver ($5K-$25K): 0.7
- Bronze (<$5K): 0.5

### Final ICP Score Calculation:
```
ICP Score = (Vertical √ó W1 + Size √ó W2 + Adoption √ó W3 + Relationship √ó W4) √ó 100
```

Where W1-W4 are the adjustable weights that must sum to 1.0.

## Usage Tips

1. **Experiment with Weights**: Try different combinations to see how they affect customer rankings
2. **Monitor Weight Sum**: Ensure weights always sum to 1.0 for valid scores
3. **Focus on High Scores**: Customers with scores ‚â•70 are typically high-value prospects
4. **Export Results**: Download updated scores after finding optimal weights
5. **Industry Analysis**: Use the industry charts to understand vertical performance
