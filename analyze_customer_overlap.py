The best approach for handling multi-location companies is hybrid matching:

1. PRIMARY: Customer ID matching (fast, accurate)
2. FALLBACK: Company name matching (catches multi-location cases)

This would work as follows:
- First, match customers by exact Customer ID
- For unmatched customers, try fuzzy company name matching
- This catches cases where Stratasys ID 108 gets revenue data
  but Stratasys IDs 129642, 317785, etc. don't

Implementation steps:
1. Update dashboard matching logic to use hybrid approach
2. Add company name normalization function
3. Add matching success reporting
4. Optionally create parent company mapping table
